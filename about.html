            <h1>Programme Educational Objectives (PEO)</h1>
<h3>Name of Programme: Bachelor of Technology (Computer Engineering)</h3>
<p class="information">
A graduate in the discipline of Computer Engineering is generally expected to have three kinds of knowledge.
First, the graduate should have conceptual knowledge of the core topics of Computer Science. Second, she/he
should have knowledge of mathematical formalism underlying various programming concepts. Third,
graduates in the discipline of Computer Engineering should have the knowledge of the state of the
technologies and tools so that he/she can apply the principles of Computer Science to solve real-life problems
from diverse application domains. The programme of B.Tech in Computer Engineering at
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University (DBATU) essentially aims to meet these broad
expectations. At the same time, the program intends to comply with the courses and syllabus available at
National Program on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) and SWAYAM. The following specific
educational objective aims to achieve these global and regional expectations.</p>
